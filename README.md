# Root-Finding-Problem-

As the title suggests, the Root-Finding Problem is the problem of finding a root of the equation f(x) = 0, where f(x) is a function of a single variable x. Write a program in the Matlab for the following methods to solve the problem of numerical approximation, the root-finding problem within 10^−5 for the given problem.

Methods:
(a) Bisection method
(b) Fixed point iteration method
(c) Newton’s method
(d) Method of False Position

Scenario:

open welcome.m file then follow the steps in it .

if you did not assign a stopping criterion by default its will by 10^−5

finally the prgram will draw a curve for the result
